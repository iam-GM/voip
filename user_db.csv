# Name:     Human readable name to help distinguish UE's. Ignored by the HSS                
# Auth:     Authentication algorithm used by the UE. Valid algorithms are XOR               
#           (xor) and MILENAGE (mil)                                                        
# IMSI:     UE's IMSI value                                                                 
# Key:      UE's key, where other keys are derived from. Stored in hexadecimal              
# OP_Type:  Operator's code type, either OP or OPc                                          
# OP/OPc:   Operator Code/Cyphered Operator Code, stored in hexadecimal                     
# AMF:      Authentication management field, stored in hexadecimal                          
# SQN:      UE's Sequence number for freshness of the authentication                        
# QCI:      QoS Class Identifier for the UE's default bearer.                               
# IP_alloc: IP allocation stratagy for the SPGW.                                            
#           With 'dynamic' the SPGW will automatically allocate IPs                         
#           With a valid IPv4 (e.g. '172.16.0.2') the UE will have a statically assigned IP.
#
